      Thank you for taking the time to file a build/installation related issue 
      report. Before creating a new issue, please be sure to take a few minutes
      to check the issue tracker for existing `build/install issue`. 

      Before submitting issue:
        1. Search for [similar issues](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/issues).
        2. For Python issues, please test with the [latest development wheel](http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/getting_started.html#development-version-pip). It may be already fixed!
        3. Please check with the documentation properly.
          3.a. [Installing from PyPI or Conda](http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/getting_started.html#installing-from-pypi-or-conda).
          3.b. [Build from source](http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/compilation.html#build-from-source).

      Please provide step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
      Please describe the installation method (e.g. building from source,
      Anaconda, pip), your OS and NumPy/Python version information.
      Providing *detailed* instructions is crucial for other to help with the issues.
      Please modify the following example.

      # I first clone Open3D by:
      git clone https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D.git
      cd Open3D

      # Then, I build Open3D with:
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake -DUSE_BLAS=ON ..
      make -j$(nproc) 
    render: shell

      Provide the *full* error message.
      It is even better to attach your terminal commands and the full terminal outputs.
      Provide screenshots if applicable. If you are reporting a segfault, please include a GDB traceback.

      When I build Open3D, I get the following error:
