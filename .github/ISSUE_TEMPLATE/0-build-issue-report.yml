    value: >
      #### I first clone Open3D by:

      ```

      git clone https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D.git

      cd Open3D

      ```
      

      #### Then, I build Open3D (on Ubuntu 20.04, with CUDA 11.5) with:

      ```

      mkdir build

      cd build

      cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_CUDA_MODULE=OFF -DUSE_BLAS=ON -DBUILD_WEBRTC=OFF ..

      make -j$(nproc)

      ```

      Provide the *full* error message. It is even better to provide your 
      terminal commands and the full terminal outputs. If you are 
      reporting a segfault, please include a GDB traceback.

      When I build Open3D, I get the following error:
